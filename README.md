This is a project by Antonio, with the contributions of Sana, Lateef, Aiman and Ajesh. This repository contains Python (and more!) code that we have written over the years during our time in Bath Spa University and beyond! If you’re a Bath Spa student, especially someone who is going through Computing courses, consider going through our repository and see if you can learn something new! 

# About

The goal of this project is to be a database for how a code might look like to accomplish a particular task, as well as give additional information on how the code works and point to resources for more information. Now, you don’t need to use ChatGPT to write the code for you!
