# Hi! Welcome to CodeGuardian.
![200x200](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b613adf3-b22b-4c07-b636-993fbd4ac746)

This is a project by Antonio, with the contributions of Sana, Lateef, Aiman and Ajesh. This repository contains Python (and more!) code that we have written over the years during our time in Bath Spa University and beyond! If youâ€™re a Bath Spa student, especially someone who is going through Computing courses, consider going through our repository and see if you can learn something new! 

This Github repository stores all the code that could be found on our [official site](https://pond-biplane-31b.notion.site/1a963cb190b680fc8999c903632da8d1?v=1e863cb190b68098a9a7000c24a53d2d&pvs=73), as an alternative means to view the code.

# About

The goal of this project is to be a collection of code that accomplish a particular task, and to show it to the world!
