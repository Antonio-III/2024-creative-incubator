# Hi! Welcome to CodeGuardian.
This is a project by Antonio, with the contributions of Sana, Lateef, Aiman and Ajesh. This website contains Python (and more!) code that we have written over the years during our time in Bath Spa University as well as explanations for how the code works! If you’re a Bath Spa student, especially someone who is going through Computing courses, consider going through our repository and see if you can learn something new! 

# About

The goal of this project is to be a database for how a code might look like to accomplish a particular task, as well as give additional information on how the code works. Now, you don’t need to use ChatGPT to write the code for you!
